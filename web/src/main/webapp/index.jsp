  <h1>JSP Example Web Page</h1>
  <p>
  <h2>Automated Dev Pipelines Are Cool</h2>
    This is a very simple example web page on a JSP.

    This example web page on a JSP should update automatically via Jenkins.
    Like a boss.

  Meta refresh is a method of instructing a web browser to automatically refresh the current web page or frame after a given time interval, using an HTML meta element with the http-equiv parameter set to "refresh" and a content parameter giving the time interval in seconds. It is also possible to instruct the browser to fetch a different URL when the page is refreshed, by including the alternative URL in the content parameter. By setting the refresh time interval to zero (or a very low value), meta refresh can be used as a method of URL redirection.
